# Monte Carlo Method
 The final project of the Engineering Probability and Statistics course - Fall 2018

## Description
There are 5 tasks included in this project. Each task is explain below.

### Task 1
In this task, the rejection method is used to make a random number generator with the desired distribution function from a standard uniform random number generator. The desired distribution function in this task is f(x) = 1.5sqrt(x). First, I explained in the report how to generate a random number with a distribution function of 1.5sqrt(x) using a standard uniform number generator. I found the equation to achieve this goal. After that, to prove the result of the obtained conversion equation, by generating many uniform random numbers and feeding the equation with it, and comparing the output with 1.5sqrt(x), the functionality of the obtained equation has shown to be correct. A picture of a histogram illustrating the results provided in the report file.

### Task 2
In this task,
